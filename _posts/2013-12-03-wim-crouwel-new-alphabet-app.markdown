The idea to create an application for design icon Wim Crouwel, started with Toon Lauwen and Ed Annink (1956 â€“ 2012). The purpose of the app was to preserve our Dutch Design heritage, starting with the iconic [New Alphabet][newAlphabet]{:target="_blank"} by Wim Crouwel.

The New Alphabet was, for its age, an revolutionary take on type design. Presented in 1967, the font was made for the newest technologies of it's time. Embracing the restrictions of the cathode-ray tube, that was only capable of making horizontal and vertical lines. To coop with the restrictions the font only uses straight lines in a grid consisting of 5 by 9 units.

The app was designed to emphasize the grid. Placing the player in the shoes of Wim Crouwel, the player has to make the same design decisions while constructing the alphabet by placing blocks on the 5 by 9 grid. The app starts with relatively easy letterforms like the c, raising the difficulty with each letterform. 

The app was designed in cooperation with other students from the Royal Academy of Arts, The Hague. Development of the app was completed by Bram de Leeuw. You can check out the source code on [GitHub][github]{:target="_blank"}.

The used fonts are property of Foundry Types LTD.
