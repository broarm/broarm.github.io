To learn about databases and data visualization, we where tasked with the assignment of creating a database of our own. As I am a film enthusiast with a fairly large collections of dvd's I started to administrate my personal collection linking it to available data I could scrape from the internet. The obvious meta data like Title, Actors, Directors etc. But also linking the spoken words, scraped from subtitle sites, and my personal appreciation of the film.

With the dataset I started to look for correlations, color coding the results.The final visualization consists of an silkscreened shirt with the backs of the dvd's arranged by color code.
